  abstract_zh : [我好想做嘉然小姐的狗啊。可是嘉然小姐说她喜欢的是猫，我哭了。我知道既不是狗也不是猫的我为什么要哭的。因为我其实是一只老鼠。我从没奢望嘉然小姐能喜欢自己。我明白的，所有人都喜欢理解余裕上手天才打钱的萌萌的狗狗或者猫猫，没有人会喜欢阴湿带病的老鼠。但我还是问了嘉然小姐:「我能不能做你的狗？」我知道我是注定做不了狗的。但如果她喜欢狗，我就可以一直在身边看着她了，哪怕她怀里抱着的永远都是狗。可是她说喜欢的是猫。她现在还在看着我，还在逗我开心，是因为猫还没有出现，只有我这老鼠每天蹑手蹑脚地从洞里爬出来，远远地和她对视。等她喜欢的猫来了的时候，我就该重新滚回我的洞了吧。但我还是好喜欢她，她能在我还在她身边的时候多看我几眼吗？嘉然小姐说接下来的每个圣诞夜都要和大家一起过。我不知道大家指哪些人。好希望这个集合能够对我做一次胞吞。
  猫猫还在害怕嘉然小姐。我会去把她爱的猫猫引来的。我知道稍有不慎，我就会葬身猫口。那时候嘉然小姐大概会把我的身体好好地装起来扔到门外吧。那我就成了一包鼠条，嘻嘻我希望她能把我扔得近一点，因为我还是好喜欢她。会一直喜欢下去的。
  我的灵魂透过窗户向里面看去，挂着的铃铛在轻轻鸣响，嘉然小姐慵懒地靠在沙发上，表演得非常温顺的橘猫坐在她的肩膀。壁炉的火光照在她的脸庞，我冻僵的心脏在风里微微发烫。],

  abstract_en : [I want to be Miss Diana's dog.
    But Miss Diana said that she likes cats, so I cried.
    I know the reason why I cried as neither a cat nor a dog. I am actually a mouse instead.
    I have never hope that Miss Diana would like me. I understand, that everyone likes dogs or cats who are outstanding, smart, talented, rich and adorable. No one likes cold and ill mice.
    But I still asked Miss Diana: "Can I be your dog?"
    I know I can't be a dog anyways. But if she likes dogs, I can always watch her by her side, even if she always hug a real dog.
    But she said that she likes cats.
    She was still looking at me now, still making me laugh because the cat hasn't appeared yet, only a mouse like me crawl out of the hole every day, looking at her from a distance.
    When the cat which she likes comes, I shall then return to my hole again.
    But I still like her so much. Will she gave me more attention when I am still around her?
    Miss Diana said that she would spend every Christmas Eve with us. I don't know who the word "us" includes, but I hope I will be one of this collection.

    Catty are still afraid of Miss Diana.
    I would attract the kitten for her.
    I know that I would be eaten by the cat if I am not cautious enough.
    By that time, Miss Diana would probably pack up my body in a nice way and throw me out of the door.
    Then I become a pack of rat chips, lol.
    I hope she won't throw me so far because I would still like her until Forever.

    My soul looks inside through the window, where the bells rang softly, and Miss Diana leaned back on the sofa lazily with an orange cat sat on her shoulder, which pretends to be tame. Her face was enlightened by the dancing flames in the fireplace, while my frozen heart slightly burns in the wind.],
